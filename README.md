# Blocktag

# WHY?
In all the dApps like DEX and farms, all wallets, accounts and transactions are pure codes.
Would it be cool if dApps could, instead, show:
- Tag a wallet address (0xABCDEFGHIJ... to --> Jacky's Wallet
- Tag a transaction Id with note like: Swapping ETH to USDT for Jack.

# PAIN
Right now, EtherScan has this feature on the Ethereum Mainnet. However:
- Saved tags are only availble in the EtherScan site only.
- Tagging capability is limited to certain blockchains only (Goerli, Polygon, Avax, etc).
- Saved tags are not visible on any other apps.

# SOLUTION
Blocktag is a smart-contract that can be deployed to any EMV (Ethereum based blockchains).
All tags and notes are stored in the blockchain it is deployed in.
ANY dApp can just read the tags & notes from the smart-contract and show it to the users.

The crypto-sphere need to simplify the display from the users.


# HOW TO USE?
describe how to use Blocktag.


# CALL TO ACTION!
Are you a dApp developer?  MetaMask? DEX? Please integrate your Web3 dapp to pull and display these tags instead.
It will make fantastic UX.

Blocktag is completely FREE to use (read). Only need to pay for gas for storing. 


# SECURITY ALERT!
Everything stored in the blockchain are public information. DO NOT STORE SENSITIVE DATA.
If needed, encrypt the text before storing.
